# Application Introduction

This project was created to demo full-stack applications using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). This is the frontend repository.  
Here is the [Backend REST API](https://github.com/nathanbirch/cse341-contacts).

This frontend interface is provided to students who learn how to create REST APIs in Node and they develop the Contacts API with specific routing and functional instruction. They are able to use this interface to test their API endpoints having to figure out CORS.
